# Weather Dashboard

This app was designed to provide user with an interactive weather dashboard. The user can search for a city to get the current weather and a five day forecast presented to them. Each search then creates a button that repeats the search for that city.

## Functionality

- When the page is loaded the user is presented with a blank weather dashboard. The default city is set to Chicago, but no weather is displayed.
- When the user searches for a city the current weather is presented and the five day forecast is also presented. 
- When the user searches for a city a button with that cities name is created under the search bar.
- When one of the past search buttons is clicked it repeats the search of the city on the button.
- The website is designed to be a responsive site, working well on multiple screen sizes as well as mobile.

## Technologies Used

- CSS (Framework: Materialize CSS) 
- HTML
- Javascript
- Open Weather API

## Known Bugs

- Pressing enter to search instead of clicking the search button refreshes the page without searching.
- Sometimes the api call gets blocked by github pages.
- The past search buttons don't always update the city displayed above the current weather display.
